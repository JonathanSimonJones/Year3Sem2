Stuff to fix:

Moving of alien is a real hack atm
Add different collision response to building piece as set position isnt descriptive enough
Change code so that when one piece is selected then another piece cannot and set its z to higher than everything else
Robot width and height currently hard coded, probably means aliens is aswell
The spawning of the robot when all the parts are put together is really hacked, put silhouette bool in buildpiece, make a build piece set class
