Questions:

switching levels, are we going to have a container with a pointer to all the different levels, which then means 
that all the levels constantly exist. Or are we going to have a level initialise and then deinitilise after the player has left.
Problem being that some things need to be consistent ie fork level and ship level

Shadows on the robot is wrong when he is flipped, shadows are on the same side 

Saving feature

In build piece, change function (position centre at) to set position?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stuff to fix:

Fix how objects sizes are calculated and how they are placed on the screen 
Change code so that when one piece its z to higher than everything else
The spawning of the robot when all the parts are put together is really hacked, put silhouette bool in buildpiece, make a build piece set class
Create puzzel class and have each puzzel fit into a different puzzel object
Put alien and player movement into level class as it consistent between each level
Check comments in build piece to see if they are still correct
Add functionality so that when a building piece is placed on the silhouette it cannot be moved
Create a class that encapsulates the building piece and its silhouette
buildPieceBeingMoved_ in ship level feels quite dangerous, consider changing it.
See if there is a touch release method.
Removing code relating to alien being fixed in the center of the screen.
Change getVelocitySet to isVelocitySet.

Completed:
Fix how robot follows alien
Moving of alien is a real hack atm
Add different collision response to building piece as set position isnt descriptive enough
Robot width and height currently hard coded, probably means aliens is aswell
Make sure the player can hold onto a build piece while they are pressing it
