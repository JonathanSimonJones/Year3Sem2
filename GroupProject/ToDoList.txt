Questions:

switching levels, are we going to have a container with a pointer to all the different levels, which then means 
that all the levels constantly exist. Or are we going to have a level initialise and then deinitilise after the player has left.
Problem being that some things need to be consistent ie fork level and ship level

Stuff to fix:

Moving of alien is a real hack atm
Add different collision response to building piece as set position isnt descriptive enough
Change code so that when one piece is selected then another piece cannot and set its z to higher than everything else
Robot width and height currently hard coded, probably means aliens is aswell
The spawning of the robot when all the parts are put together is really hacked, put silhouette bool in buildpiece, make a build piece set class
